            The Molecular Devices high-content suite couples high-throughput plate reading and quantitative imaging microscopy with powerful artificial intelligence supported analytics to empower and accelerate transformative research. The SpectraMax iD3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader provides luminescence, absorbance and fluorescence reading capabilities in multiple plate formats, while the ImageXpress Confocal HT.ai High-Content Imaging System provides both widefield and confocal microscopy capabilities and up to 8-fluorescent channels to enable the acquisition of high-resolution, multidimensional (2D, 3D and 4D) images from either plates or microscopy slides. The Molecular Devices suite also houses a plate incubator and plate hotel that can be accessed by the PreciseFlex 400 Robotic Arm to facilitate fully automated high-throughput plate reading/imaging of either live (up to 40 plates simultaneously) or traditional end-point/fixed (up to 80 plates) experiments. Finally, the suite is complimented by two high-end workstations equipped with IN Carta Image Analysis Software, allowing researchers to harness the power of artificial intelligence to help inform and expedite their data analyses.
